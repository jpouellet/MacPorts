description         library to handle keyboard descriptions
long_description    xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, \
                    including loading them from disk, parsing them and \
                    handling their state. It's mainly meant for client \
                    toolkits, window systems, and other system applications\; \
                    currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt, \
                    Clutter, and more. It is also used by some XCB \
                    applications for proper keyboard support.
